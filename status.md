Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
I have made the starting screen, and added in some of the characters in a pixelated format. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I haven't added in the background music, multiple buttons, and the multiple locations for the battles.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
I couldn't figure out how to change the background music and location for each battle that was taking 
place. And how to keep the characters moving after they hit each other and stay active. 
Since I'm having so many problems with my current plan, I would like to change my project to a discord bot instead. I contacted my lab section leader today and they approved the idea, and I emailed Professor Rosen as well, and received approval from him too.
